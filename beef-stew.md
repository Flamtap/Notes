1. Brown meat in hot oil. Don't crowd pan, set aside browned peices in
   batches.

2. Add water/stock, worcestershire sauce, garlic, bay leaves, onion, salt,
   pepper, and any other spices desired. Cover and simmer for a minimum of
   1 hour, up to 3.

3. Remove bay leaves and garlic cloves. Add carrots, potatoes, and peas. 
   Cover and cook 30 to 40 minutes longer, until carrots and potatoes reach
